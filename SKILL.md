# Effect Best Practices

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building production-ready applications using Effect TypeScript.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Setting up a new Effect TypeScript project
- Implementing error handling with Effect
- Configuring TypeScript for optimal Effect development
- Choosing appropriate Effect data types and structures
- Following Effect best practices and patterns
- Troubleshooting Effect-related type errors

## How to Use This Skill

### Reference Documentation

All best practices are organized in the `references/` directory:

- **repo-setup.md** - Project setup, dependencies, and configuration
- **tsconfig.md** - TypeScript configuration for Effect projects
- **error-handling.md** - Error handling patterns and best practices
- **data-types.md** - Choosing the right Effect data types
- **best-practices.md** - General Effect best practices and patterns
- **index.md** - Overview and quick reference

### Workflow

1. Identify the specific area (setup, error handling, types, etc.)
2. Read the relevant reference document from `references/`
3. Apply the patterns and guidance to the codebase
4. Verify type safety and best practice compliance

## Key Principles

- Type safety first - leverage Effect's type system fully
- Explicit error handling - use Effect's error channels
- Composition over inheritance - build with Effect's combinators
- Resource safety - use Effect's resource management primitives
